# Portfolio

The purpose of this portfolio is to give a comprehensive overview of my computer science skillset. This is both useful for me to review past material that I have learned as well as for employers determining whether to hire me or not. The following will be included:

  - Projects
  - Courses completed
  - Personal Wiki
  - Resume

### Projects

Throughout my college experience, I have always believed that most of my learning will come from outside of the classroom. As a result, I have worked on many projects. This section will include all the projects that I have done outside of class as well as links to source code.

### Courses

A list of courses with course name, professor, term taken, concepts covered, and grade received that are relevant for computer science.

For courses where the grade is not as high as I might have liked, there will be attached work that demonstrates mastery of the material covered in the class along with an explanation of why the grade wasn't good.

### Personal Wiki

This is mostly for me to keep an organized, written record of knowledge that I obtain for future reference. This can also be useful for an employer trying to determine which concepts I may know already.

Note: There may be SOME concepts that I learned that aren't included. 

### Resume

A publicly available resume to view. Download links will be available.
